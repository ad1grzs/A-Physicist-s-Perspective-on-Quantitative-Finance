# A Physicist's Perspective on Quantitative Fiance 📈🧠⚛️

Welcome to my self-driven journey into **quantitative finance**, where I approach financial modeling with a physicist’s mindset — blending theory, simulation, and real-world data analysis.

This repository is a structured portfolio of projects that progressively build core competencies. Topics range from stochastic processes to derivatives pricing, time series modeling, portfolio optimization, and more.

Each project is complemented by theoretical notes, also available in [PDF format](./notes.pdf), to provide foundation and quick reference. These are pre-eliminary and will be revised and updated periodically.

## 🌌 Philosophy

As a physicist, I'm trained to model complex, noisy systems — and financial markets are just that. The aim of this portfolio is to:

- Reframe financial models through **physics-based intuition**.
- **Derive and simulate** models using techniques from stochastic calculus and statistical mechanics.
- Integrate **real financial data** for empirical validation.
- Write clean, modular **Python code** for each concept.
- Document the journey clearly for future employers, collaborators, and learners.

> 🚧 More projects will be added as the portfolio evolves. Each folder is self-contained, with its own notebook/code, figures, and brief writeup.
